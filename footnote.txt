Note: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were predicted by NCBIâ€™s AMRFinderPlus tool. Carbapanemase resistance genes are a subclass of AMR genes. The presence of an AMR gene does not necessarily indicate that the isolate is resistant to the corresponding antibiotic. Nor does it mean that that gene provides resistance to all antibiotics within the same class. Users are cautioned against over-interpretation.
