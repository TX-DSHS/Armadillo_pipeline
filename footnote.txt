*Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were predicted by NCBI’s AMRFinderPlus tool. Carbapanemase resistance genes are from a subclass of AMR genes. The presence of a gene encoding an antimicrobial resistance protein does not necessarily indicate that the isolate carrying the gene is resistance to the corresponding antibiotic. AMR genes must be expressed to confer resistance. An enzyme that acts on a class of antibiotics, such as the cephalosporins, may confer resistance to some but not others. Many AMR proteins reduce antibiotic susceptibility somewhat, but not sufficiently to change the isolate from “sensitive” to “intermediate” or “resistant”. Meanwhile, an isolate may gain resistance to an antibiotic by mutation processes, such as the loss of a porin required to allow the antibiotic into the cell. For some families of AMR proteins, especially those borne on plasmids, correlations of genotype to phenotype are much more easily deciphered, but users are cautioned against over-interpretation.<br>
